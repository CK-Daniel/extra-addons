# Implementation Summary: WooCommerce Product Add-ons Conditional Logic

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Complex Circular Dependency Detection
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Created `class-wc-product-addons-dependency-graph.php`
- Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to detect complex circular dependencies
- Detects both simple loops (A→B→A) and complex patterns (A→B→C→A)
- Provides topological sorting for proper evaluation order
- Returns detailed cycle information for debugging

**Key Features**:
- Multi-path cycle detection
- Evaluation layer generation
- Visual graph representation for debugging

### 2. Conflict Resolution Mechanism
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Created `class-wc-product-addons-rule-conflict-resolver.php`
- Supports 6 conflict resolution strategies:
  1. Priority-based (higher priority wins)
  2. First wins (first rule in evaluation order)
  3. Last wins (last rule in evaluation order)
  4. Merge (combine non-conflicting parts)
  5. Most restrictive (e.g., hide wins over show)
  6. Least restrictive (e.g., show wins over hide)

**Key Features**:
- Automatic conflict detection
- Customizable resolution strategy
- Conflict logging for debugging
- Support for complex action merging

### 3. Enhanced Cascading Evaluation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Increased cascade limit from 10 to 20 iterations
- Added proper user notifications when limit is reached
- Implemented state change detection to stop unnecessary iterations
- Added admin notices for cascade limit warnings

**Key Features**:
- Configurable iteration limit
- Early termination when state stabilizes
- User-friendly notifications
- Debug mode for tracking iterations

### 4. State Synchronization (Frontend/Backend)
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Created unified addon identifier system (`class-wc-product-addons-addon-identifier.php`)
- Enhanced frontend with comprehensive data attributes
- Implemented flexible name matching for cross-scope rules
- Added dynamic state management with reset functionality

**Key Features**:
- Consistent addon identification across frontend/backend
- Support for global rules affecting product-specific addons
- Price modifications persist to cart (with hooks)
- Real-time state synchronization

### 5. AJAX Request Management
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Created `class-wc-product-addons-ajax-queue.php`
- Implements request queuing with sequence numbers
- Automatic cancellation of outdated requests
- Prevents race conditions

**Key Features**:
- Request queuing and prioritization
- Automatic cancellation of pending requests
- Sequence tracking to ignore outdated responses
- Debounced evaluation for performance

## Additional Features Implemented

### 6. Per-Option Price Settings
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Admin interface supports "Entire addon" vs "Specific option" targeting
- JavaScript properly collects and sends option-specific data
- Backend correctly processes per-option price modifications
- Frontend applies prices to specific options when configured

**Key Features**:
- Target level selector in admin UI
- Option dropdown populated dynamically
- Visual indicators for option-level actions
- Support for both set price and adjust price actions

### 7. Dynamic State Management
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- `resetAllModifications()` function resets all changes before applying current rules
- Original addon data preserved during initialization
- All modifications are reversible
- Supports multiple simultaneous rules

**Key Features**:
- Complete state reset before each evaluation
- Original price preservation
- Dynamic show/hide with state restoration
- No accumulation of modifications

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Circular Dependency Test
```sql
-- Create rules that form a cycle
Rule 1: When A selected → Hide B
Rule 2: When B hidden → Show C
Rule 3: When C shown → Select A
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution Test
```sql
-- Create conflicting rules
Rule 1 (Priority 10): When X selected → Set price to $20
Rule 2 (Priority 5): When X selected → Set price to $30
-- With priority strategy, Rule 2 should win
```

### 3. Per-Option Price Test
1. Create price rule targeting specific option
2. Verify only that option's price changes
3. Test cart persistence

### 4. Dynamic State Test
1. Create hide/show rules
2. Change selections multiple times
3. Verify elements return to original state

## Known Limitations

1. **Cart Price Persistence**: While frontend price changes work, full cart persistence may need additional session storage implementation
2. **Complex Formulas**: Formula-based pricing is implemented but not exposed in UI
3. **Performance**: Large numbers of rules (100+) may impact page load time

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Rule Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for complex rule creation
2. **Rule Templates**: Pre-built rule templates for common scenarios
3. **Performance Optimization**: Rule caching and lazy evaluation
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Track which rules fire most often
5. **A/B Testing**: Support for testing different rule configurations

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Mode**: Set `WP_DEBUG` to true
2. **Check Console**: Detailed logging in browser console
3. **View Metadata**: Rules include `_metadata` with evaluation details
4. **Conflict Log**: Check conflict resolver log for resolution decisions
5. **AJAX Monitoring**: Network tab shows rule evaluation requests

## Integration Points

The conditional logic system integrates with:
- WooCommerce cart calculations
- Product addon validation
- AJAX add-to-cart functionality
- Admin product editing interface
- Global addon management

All integration points use WordPress hooks and filters for maximum compatibility.
