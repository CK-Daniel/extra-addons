# Dynamic State Management for Conditional Logic

## Overview

The conditional logic system now implements complete dynamic state management. This ensures that:

1. **All modifications are reversible**: When conditions change, elements return to their original state
2. **Multiple rules work together**: The system evaluates all rules and applies only the currently active ones
3. **No conflicts**: Each evaluation starts fresh, preventing accumulation of modifications

## How It Works

### 1. State Reset Before Each Evaluation

Every time rules are evaluated, the system first calls `resetAllModifications()` which:

- Shows all previously hidden addons/options
- Restores original prices
- Resets required/optional states
- Removes all conditional logic classes

### 2. Apply Active Rules

After reset, only the rules whose conditions are currently met are applied:

```javascript
// Example flow:
1. User selects "test" â†’ Hide "tester123" option
2. User changes selection â†’ Reset all â†’ No rules apply â†’ "tester123" is visible again
3. User selects "test" again â†’ Hide "tester123" option
```

### 3. Original State Preservation

The system stores original addon data during initialization:

```javascript
originalAddons[addonId] = {
    element: jQuery element,
    name: display name,
    identifier: unique ID,
    prices: { option1: 100, option2: 200 },
    required: true/false
}
```

## Key Features

### Dynamic Option Visibility

- Options are marked with `conditional-logic-hidden` class
- Hidden options are disabled to prevent selection
- If a hidden option was selected, it's automatically deselected

### Price Modifications

- Original prices are preserved
- Price changes are applied dynamically
- When rules no longer apply, prices revert to original

### Cascading Rules

Multiple rules can affect the same element:

```sql
-- Rule 1: Hide option when condition A
-- Rule 2: Change price when condition B
-- Rule 3: Make required when condition C

-- All three can be active simultaneously
```

### State Tracking

The system tracks:
- Current selections
- Applied modifications
- Original values
- Rule evaluation results

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Hide/Show

1. Rule: "When Test is selected, hide Tester123"
2. User selects Test â†’ Tester123 is hidden
3. User selects Test2 â†’ Tester123 is shown again

### Scenario 2: Multiple Rules

1. Rule A: "When Test is selected, hide Option1"
2. Rule B: "When Test2 is selected, hide Option2"
3. User selects Test â†’ Only Option1 is hidden
4. User selects Test2 â†’ Only Option2 is hidden
5. Both rules can be active if using checkboxes

### Scenario 3: Price Changes

1. Rule: "When Premium selected, set Basic price to $50"
2. User selects Premium â†’ Basic shows $50
3. User deselects Premium â†’ Basic returns to original price

## Benefits

1. **Predictable behavior**: Users always know what to expect
2. **Clean state**: No accumulated modifications
3. **Performance**: Only active rules are processed
4. **Flexibility**: Supports complex rule combinations
5. **Reliability**: No conflicts between rules

## Technical Implementation

### Reset Process

```javascript
resetAllModifications() {
    // 1. Show all hidden elements
    $('.conditional-logic-hidden').show().removeClass('conditional-logic-hidden');
    
    // 2. Restore original prices
    for each addon in originalAddons {
        resetAddonPrices(addon.element, addon.prices);
    }
    
    // 3. Restore required states
    for each addon in originalAddons {
        setAddonRequired(addon.element, addon.required);
    }
}
```

### Evaluation Flow

```javascript
evaluateAllConditions() {
    // 1. Gather current state
    // 2. Send to server for rule evaluation
    // 3. Receive active rules
    // 4. Reset all modifications
    // 5. Apply only active rules
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use rule keys, not values** in rule definitions
2. **Test with multiple rules** to ensure proper interaction
3. **Use browser console** to monitor rule evaluation
4. **Check for the reset message** in console logs

## Debugging

Enable debug logging to see:
- "ðŸ”„ Resetting all modifications to default state"
- "ðŸ”§ Applying action: [action details]"
- "âœ¨ All rule actions applied"

This ensures you can track the complete lifecycle of rule evaluation.
